# GUICourierApp
A courier app I developed during my OOP course, using the Observer design pattern
- We have a main window, the courier company window - which stores and can add recipients
- Each courier has one window, where they have two types of recipients:
       - Recipients that are in range of the courier
       - Recipients that live on a street that the courier covers
